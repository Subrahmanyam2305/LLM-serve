It's been a long road so far, but we're doing okay, I think.\n\n11:09:44:00 My name is Phyllis, and my husband, Jerry, has LEMS.\n\n11:10:00:00 My name is Phyllis, and my husband, Jerry, has LEMS, and I'm his caregiver.\n\n11:10:17:00 We have two grandchildren that we spend lots of times with. I have a life other than being a caregiver. I play tennis and golf. And I'm involved in various community activities, and I love to swim. And that's one thing that I can do with my husband because he's able to do that.\n\n11:11:13:00 Going back to the beginning, it's been a very uneven road, sometimes easy, sometimes quite rough. \n\n11:11:24:00 The diagnosis took approximately two years, going to many, many doctors, many institutions, doing a lot of research ourselves. And, finally, I came to the conclusion that we have to go to the Mayo Clinic because Lambert and Eaton are the doctors that found this disease, and they're from the Mayo Clinic, or they were from the Mayo Clinic.\n\n11:11:52:00 So, we spent ten days out in Rochester, Minnesota, freezing, two Floridians freezing in Minnesota. And finally, on the last day, with the last test, the diagnosis came down that it was LEMS, and we went, \"Huh? What?\" Never heard of it, really, I mean.\n\n11:12:14:00 And we got a treatment plan from them, which we took home with us to Florida. However, it's been very, very difficult to find any kind of physician that ever heard of this condition or disease \u2013 whatever you want to call it.\n\n11:12:32:00 And now, I'm just trying to do research myself on how this came about. I mean it doesn't run in his family. Nobody ever heard of it. \n\n11:12:45:00 And I've been talking to some of the people here, some of the patients, and I'm just coming to the conclusion, my own un-medical way, that it's a result of some kind of a medical trauma because this happened to my husband right after he had a knee replacement, and some of the other people were telling me also they had just come out of the hospital and they got this all of a sudden, so.\n\n11:13:13:00\nInterviewer: Hmm.
